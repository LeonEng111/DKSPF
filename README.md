# Domain Knowledge-guided Semantic Prediction Framework
## Overview

This repository holds the implementation and description of our current paper (An Efficient Domain Knowledge-guided Semantic Prediction Framework for Pathological Subtypes based on Radiologic Images with Limited Annotation)

> The proposed algorithms to support the findings of this study are still under early-stage development. We need further code organization and encapsulation for better demonstration.

> Related issues or further assistance could be raised upon reasonable request.
